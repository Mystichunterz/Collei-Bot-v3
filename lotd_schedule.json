      "description": "In the Hidden Strife event at Dawn Winery, Diluc's letters appear in significant locations: Albedo and Alice's camp in Dragonspine, Jean and Varka's room in the Grand Master's quarters, and the Knights of Favonius rooftop for Kaeya. Kaeya's location reveals extra lore snippets about his background.\n\nKaeya and his father wrote a message despite their family's principle against recording their history. The message emphasized that the Alberich Clan, though not of royal blood, served as regents when the one-eyed king Irmin's strength failed. Kaeya saved a piece of this message, noting it cannot serve as identification and reflects his father's sorrowful handwriting. This reveals that the Alberichs are not royalty, debunking theories of Kaeya being a Khaenri'ahn prince. Instead, they stepped in for the failing Khaenri'ahn royalty.\n\nThe mention of Irmin, possibly another name for Odin, ties to the World Tree connections like the Irminsul trees reaching the Abyss and Leyline Blossoms. It's intriguing that the Alberichs recorded their history despite their law against it, possibly as an exercise for Kaeya to understand their intentions.\n\nKaeya referring to his father as \"Father\" hints at a formal or distant relationship, or perhaps his 'father' isn't his biological parent. The Alberich clan's role parallels Loki's in Norse mythology, with potential ties to fire and ice, adding depth to Kaeya's Cryo element despite Loki being a god of fire and an ice giant.\n\nThese few lines could offer significant insights into Kaeya's background, sparking theories about his role and the Alberich clan's influence. The event hints at a rich story involving Kaeya and Diluc, with potential future arcs exploring their connection to Khaenri'ah and conflicts with characters like Dottore. While a full exploration of Khaenri'ah's story may take time, events focusing on Kaeya and Diluc's lore would be compelling.",
