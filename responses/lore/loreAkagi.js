She was a fleet carrier, the first of her nation. Her three decks lost effectiveness through the passage of time, and they were consolidated into one. It was in this form that she gained a reputation as her fleet\'s flagship, gaining infamy, raining down destruction and laying waste to her enemies. This, however, would all come to an end in a single decisive battle. With a pull of a trigger, her death sentence was signed.`
